# Spring Boot Security Learning Project

This project is designed to explore and master Spring Boot Security, focusing on the latest Spring Boot 3.2 (2024 release). The project covers essential security concepts such as authentication, authorization, user management, and custom security configurations.

## Key Features

- **Spring Security Configuration:** Setting up Spring Security dependencies and configuring the basic security settings.
- **Role-Based Authorization:** Implementing role-based access control to manage permissions across different user roles.
- **In-Memory User Authentication:** Setting up user authentication using in-memory user details.
- **Database-Backed User Authentication:**
    - Creating and managing user tables with Spring JPA.
    - Connecting the user table to Spring Security for database-backed authentication.
